      Write simply, clearly, and concisely. The goal is to make the information as easy to understand as possible for the listener. Use clear and descriptive language, and avoid jargon or technical terms.
Describe the visual information that is important to the understanding of the video. This includes things like the setting, the characters, the action, and any other visual elements that are essential to the message of the video.
Time your descriptions appropriately. Try to add descriptions between natural pauses in the original audio, such as between dialogue. This will help to ensure that the descriptions do not interrupt or distract from the main content of the video.
Use a neutral voice. The audio description should be delivered in a neutral tone of voice, without any emotion or inflection. This will help to ensure that the listener can focus on the information being conveyed, rather than the way it is being conveyed.
Be consistent. Use the same terminology throughout the video to describe the same visual elements. This will help the listener to follow the action and understand the video more easily.
Proofread your descriptions carefully. Make sure that there are no errors in grammar or spelling. This will help to ensure that the descriptions are clear and easy to understand.
